## 📂 Day 1: Variables & Data Types
Focused on the absolute building blocks of Python. Think of variables as **labeled jars** where we store different types of information.

* **Concepts:** * `str`: Textual data (e.g., "Athiya").
    * `int` & `float`: Whole numbers and precise decimals.
    * `type()`: The "X-ray" tool to see what's inside a variable.
* **Reflection:** Practiced basic variables and data types. Feeling confident about building a solid Python foundation.

## 📂 Day 2: Loops & Functions
Moved from static data to active logic. This is where we learn to **automate** tasks so we don't have to repeat code manually.

* **Concepts:** * **Functions (`def`):** Creating a "Recipe" once and using it many times.
    * **Loops:** `for` and `while` for repetition; `break`/`continue` for control.
* **Reflection:** Learned how to make code reusable. Automation through loops is a game-changer for data processing.

## 📂 Day 3: Lists & List Methods
Mastered ordered collections. Lists are essential for handling sequences of data in Data Science.



* **Concepts:** * **List Methods:** Using `append()`, `insert()`, and `pop()` to modify data.
    * **Slicing:** Extracting specific parts of a list using `[start:stop:step]`.
* **Reflection:** Practiced working with lists and iterating through them. Slicing logic is very intuitive once you visualize the indices.

## 📂 Day 4: Tuples & Sets
Explored specialized collections focusing on data integrity and uniqueness.

* **Concepts:** * **Tuples:** Understanding immutability—data that cannot be changed once set.
    * **Sets:** Collections that automatically handle unique values and remove duplicates.
    * **Set Operations:** Using logic like `intersection()` and `union()`.
* **Reflection:** Learned about immutable and unique collections. Understanding the difference between a List and a Tuple is key for data safety.
