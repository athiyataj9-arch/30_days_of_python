## 📂 Day 01 - 05: Python Foundations
* **Concepts:** Variables, Strings, Integers, and basic Logic.
* **Reflection:** Getting comfortable with Python’s clean syntax. The ease of string manipulation in Python is a game changer compared to other languages.

## 📂 Day 06 - 10: Control & Logic
* **Concepts:** For/While loops, List Comprehensions, and custom Functions.
* **Reflection:** List comprehensions make code so much more "Pythonic." I'm learning to write more with less lines.

## 📂 Day 11 - 15: File Handling & NumPy
* **Concepts:** Reading/Writing CSVs, JSON, and NumPy Array Vectorization.
* **Reflection:** NumPy is incredibly fast. Realizing that loops are often unnecessary when you can use vectorized operations was a "lightbulb" moment.

## 📂 Day 16 - 20: Pandas Data Wrangling
* **Concepts:** DataFrames, handling Missing Values, and GroupBy operations.
* **Reflection:** Pandas is the heart of Data Science. Being able to clean a messy dataset with just a few methods like `dropna()` and `fillna()` is powerful.

## 📂 Day 21: Matplotlib Basics
* **Concepts:** Line plots, Bar charts, and customizing Labels/Legends.
* **Reflection:** Visualizing data is the bridge between raw numbers and actual insights. Matplotlib is the foundation for everything visual.

## 📂 Day 22: Scatter Plots & Histograms
* **Concepts:** Identifying correlations and data distributions.
* **Reflection:** Learned that data has a "shape." Histograms help you see outliers and spread, which is vital for any statistical analysis.

## 📂 Day 23: Seaborn Styling

* **Concepts:** Advanced styling with `sns.set_theme` and Heatmaps.
* **Reflection:** Seaborn makes data look "publication-ready." The heatmap is especially powerful for identifying which features are important.

## 📂 Day 24: Statistical Analysis

* **Concepts:** Central tendency (Mean/Median), Dispersion (Std Dev), and Z-Scores.
* **Reflection:** Statistics provide the mathematical proof for the patterns I see in my charts. Understanding the "spread" is as important as the average.

## 📂 Day 25: Strings & Basic Logic
* **Concepts:** Palindromes, Anagrams, and Frequency Maps using Dictionaries.
* **Reflection:** The key to string interviews is often cleaning the data first before applying the core logic.

## 📂 Day 26: Array & List Manipulation

* **Concepts:** Hash Map optimization ($O(n)$ search) and the Two-Pointer technique.
* **Reflection:** Mastered the "Two Sum" pattern. Turning a slow $O(n^2)$ search into a lightning-fast $O(n)$ search using a dictionary is a must-know.

## 📂 Day 27: Search & Math Optimization

* **Concepts:** Binary Search ($O(\log n)$) and optimized primality testing.
* **Reflection:** Binary Search isn't just for lists; it can solve math problems like square roots. Efficiency is the name of the game.

## 📂 Day 28: Data Structures (Stacks)

* **Concepts:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle, using lists as stacks, and matching nested symbols.
* **Reflection:** Stacks are the perfect tool for any problem involving "history" or "nested" logic. Seeing how they simplify the Valid Parentheses problem was eye-opening.

## 📂 Day 29: Hashing & Grouping
* **Concepts:** Advanced Dictionary usage, sorting strings as hashable keys, and frequency analysis.
* **Reflection:** Dictionaries are likely the most powerful tool in the Python arsenal. Grouping anagrams by a common key showed me how to structure data efficiently.

## 📂 Day 30: Final Capstone - Sliding Window

* **Concepts:** Two-pointer optimization, sliding window strategy, and $O(n)$ complexity analysis.
* **Reflection:** Challenge complete! The Sliding Window technique is a brilliant way to avoid redundant nested loops. Moving from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ is the hallmark of a professional developer.
