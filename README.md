## 📂 Day 25: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Concepts:** Creating Classes, defining attributes, and using Methods to manipulate data.
* **Reflection:** Today felt like a huge leap. Instead of just running commands, I'm building blueprints for real-world objects. It makes code much more organized.

## 📂 Day 26: OOP Inheritance
* **Concepts:** Reusing code through Inheritance and using `super()` to extend functionality.
* **Reflection:** Inheritance is like a superpower for code efficiency. Why rewrite the basics when a child class can just "inherit" them?
