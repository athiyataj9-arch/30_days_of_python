## 📂 Day 1: The Foundation
Revised core syntax to ensure a strong base for data processing.
* **Concepts:** Dynamic typing, list methods (`append`), and basic function definitions.
* **Goal:** Understand how Python handles memory and basic collections.

## 📂 Day 2: Control Flow & Logic
Moved from static scripts to dynamic logic. 
* **Concepts:** Using `if-elif-else` for data validation and `for` loops for iteration.
* **Application:** Built a small logic gate to filter data points based on specific conditions.

### Why this repository?
I am building a strong Python foundation specifically tailored for **Data Science**. By documenting my progress daily, I am creating a "proof of work" portfolio that shows my transition from a coder to a data practitioner.
