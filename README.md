## 📂 Day 21: Matplotlib Basics
* **Concepts:** Creating line plots and bar charts. Customizing plots with labels, colors, and legends.
* **Reflection:** Visualization is the "bridge" between data and understanding. Seeing a line plot of my progress makes the hard work feel tangible.

## 📂 Day 22: Scatter Plots & Histograms
* **Concepts:** Visualizing data distributions with Histograms and exploring relationships between variables with Scatter Plots.
* **Reflection:** Learned that data has a "shape." Histograms help you see outliers and spread, which is vital for statistical analysis.
