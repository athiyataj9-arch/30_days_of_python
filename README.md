## 📂 Day 1: Variables & Data Types
Focused on the absolute building blocks of Python. Think of variables as **labeled jars** where we store different types of information.



* **Concepts:** * `str`: Textual data (e.g., "Athiya").
    * `int` & `float`: Whole numbers and precise decimals.
    * `type()`: The "X-ray" tool to see what's inside a variable.
    * **Casting:** Converting data (like turning the string "10" into a number) so we can do math.
* **Goal:** Understand how Python labels and stores data in memory.

## 📂 Day 2: Loops & Functions
Moved from static data to active logic. This is where we learn to **automate** tasks so we don't have to repeat code manually.



* **Concepts:** * **Functions (`def`):** Creating a "Recipe" once and using it many times.
    * **For Loops:** Repeating a task a specific number of times (e.g., counting steps).
    * **While Loops:** Running code as long as a condition is true (e.g., while battery > 0).
    * **Return:** How a function sends a result back to the main program.
* **Goal:** Use logic to make code reusable and efficient.

### Why this repository?
I am building a strong Python foundation specifically tailored for **Data Science**. By documenting my progress daily, I am creating a "proof of work" portfolio that shows my transition from a beginner to a data practitioner.
