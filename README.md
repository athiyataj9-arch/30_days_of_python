## 📂 Day 1: Variables & Data Types
Focused on the absolute building blocks of Python. Think of variables as **labeled jars** where we store different types of information.

* **Concepts:** * `str`: Textual data (e.g., "Athiya").
    * `int` & `float`: Whole numbers and precise decimals.
    * `type()`: The "X-ray" tool to see what's inside a variable.
    * **Casting:** Converting data (like turning the string "10" into a number) so we can do math.
* **Goal:** Understand how Python labels and stores data in memory.

## 📂 Day 2: Loops & Functions
Moved from static data to active logic. This is where we learn to **automate** tasks so we don't have to repeat code manually.

* **Concepts:** * **Functions (`def`):** Creating a "Recipe" once and using it many times.
    * **For Loops:** Repeating a task a specific number of times.
    * **While Loops:** Running code as long as a condition is true.
    * **Return:** How a function sends a result back to the main program.
* **Goal:** Use logic to make code reusable and efficient.

## 📂 Day 3: Lists & List Methods
Mastered ordered collections. Lists are essential for handling sequences of data in Data Science.



* **Concepts:** * **List Methods:** Using `append()`, `insert()`, and `pop()` to modify data.
    * **Slicing:** Extracting specific parts of a list using `[start:stop:step]`.
    * **Nested Lists:** Working with lists inside lists (matrices).
* **Goal:** Efficiently store and manipulate sequences of information.

## 📂 Day 4: Tuples & Sets
Explored specialized collections focusing on data integrity and uniqueness.

* **Concepts:** * **Tuples:** Understanding immutability—data that cannot be changed once set.
    * **Sets:** Collections that automatically handle unique values and remove duplicates.
    * **Set Operations:** Using logic like `intersection()` and `union()`.
* **Goal:** Choose the right data structure for security and unique data filtering.
