## 📂 Day 21: Matplotlib Basics
* **Concepts:** Creating line plots and bar charts. Customizing plots with labels, colors, and legends.
* **Reflection:** Visualization is the bridge between data and understanding. Seeing a line plot of my progress makes the hard work feel tangible.

## 📂 Day 22: Scatter Plots & Histograms
* **Concepts:** Visualizing data distributions with Histograms and exploring relationships between variables with Scatter Plots.
* **Reflection:** Learned that data has a "shape." Histograms help you see outliers and spread, which is vital for statistical analysis.

## 📂 Day 23: Seaborn Visualization

* **Concepts:** Advanced styling with `sns.set_theme`, creating violin plots for density, and heatmaps for correlation.
* **Reflection:** Seaborn makes data look "publication-ready." The heatmap is especially useful for quickly identifying which features in a dataset are important.

## 📂 Day 24: Statistical Analysis

* **Concepts:** Calculating central tendency, dispersion (standard deviation), and identifying outliers using Z-scores.
* **Reflection:** Statistics provide the mathematical proof for the patterns I see in my charts. Understanding the "spread" of data is just as important as the average.
