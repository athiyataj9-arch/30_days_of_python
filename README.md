## 📂 Day 23: Seaborn Visualization

* **Concepts:** Advanced styling with `sns.set_theme`, creating violin plots for density, and heatmaps for correlation.
* **Reflection:** Seaborn makes data look "publication-ready." The heatmap is especially useful for quickly identifying which features in a dataset are actually important.

## 📂 Day 24: Statistical Analysis
* **Concepts:** Calculating central tendency, dispersion (standard deviation), and identifying outliers using Z-scores.
* **Reflection:** Statistics provide the mathematical proof for the patterns I see in my charts. Understanding the "spread" of data is just as important as the average.
